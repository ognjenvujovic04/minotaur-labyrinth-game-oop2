# Robot Maze Escape

## Description
This is a simple console-based game developed as a project for the **OOP2** course. In this game, you control a robot navigating through a randomly generated maze, avoiding dangers, and solving puzzles to escape. The game is played using **WASD** commands for movement.

## Features
- **Maze Generation**: The game generates a maze based on user-defined dimensions.
- **Minotaur Enemy**: Avoid the minotaur roaming the maze.
- **Special Items**:
  - **Hammer**: Breaks walls to create new paths.
  - **Shield**: Prevents the minotaur from attacking.
  - **Sword**: Allows the robot to defeat the minotaur.
  - **Fog**: Limits visibility to a **3x3** area.
- **User Input**: At the start, the user specifies the maze size and the number of special items.

## Gameplay
1. Start the game by entering the desired maze dimensions and item count.
2. Navigate the maze using **WASD** commands.
3. Collect special items to gain advantages.
4. Avoid or defeat the minotaur to survive.
5. Solve the puzzle and reach the exit.

## Future Plans
- Implement a **GUI version** for a better user experience.
- Improve the **maze generation algorithm** to create more challenging layouts.
